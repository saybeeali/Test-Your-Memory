Introduce game
the Hey guys out of all the options we had to choose from I originally wanted to do the slot machine game because I thought the JavaScript would’ve been an easy job for me but then I also realized that I wanted to make a game which involved some skill so I decided to go with memory mattress instead the base of this game is just like any other memory match game where you must find each pairs match and once you do the game ends I wanted to get more creative with it but because of the time I spent on my JavaScript I could only do the emojis but as I learn more throughout this Boot Camp I’ll be definitely adding more to this game hope you guys enjoy

Heres the link of the game

My biggest challenge in this game was to get each card to flip and then stay open once they’re matched and then flip back to the original state when they’re not matched I’m very thankful to all of the instructors and all of the teacher and sisters teachers assistant which helped me get through this if it wasn’t for them I think I would’ve threw my Mac out the window


My key learnings and take away from this are that it’s always best to have an extra pair of eyes to look at your code because it could be the most simplest thing which could be blocking a very valuable function to occur and I think I’m slowly becoming a master at googling
