# Test-Your-Memory
Test Your Memory is a memory based game in which the player has to match all the cards before the timer runs out. The project was created using a lot of DOM manipulation, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Key Features
Player can only flip 2 cards at a time and once they match, the pair becomes unclickable. 
Once player wins, the timer stops and a display message pops up with how many matches they won with and a reset button to refresh the game.
Once timer runs out, Loser message comes up and player has to refresh game to retry.
